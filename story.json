  "title": "MetroTwin - Digital Twin for Urban Infrastructure",
  "overview": "A graph-based digital twin platform that models city infrastructure and runs simulations to forecast the impact of planning decisions on energy, transport, and environment.",
  "keyFeatures": [
    "Neo4j digital twin storing entities and relationships",
    "Streaming ingestion (Kafka) of sensors and transport data",
    "GNN models for forecasting demand and load",
    "Simulation orchestration with Kubernetes and Airflow",
    "Visualization dashboard with scenario comparison"
  ],
  "pros": [
    "Faster scenario evaluation (days â†’ minutes)",
    "Improved forecasting accuracy by 20%",
    "Supports cross-department urban planning"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Complex integration of multi-source geospatial & temporal data",
    "High computational requirements for GNN training",

  "problem": "City planners lack an integrated platform to simulate infrastructure changes across transport, energy, and environmental systems; decisions are often siloed and reactive.",
  "solution": "Built a Neo4j-backed digital twin combining geospatial data, building models, sensor feeds, and transport networks. Applied Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and physics-informed ML to run 'what-if' simulations and provide actionable forecasts for planners.",
  "timeline": "2022-10 - 2023-06",
  "impact": {
    "metrics": {
      "planning speed": "Reduced scenario evaluation time from days to minutes",
      "cost savings": "30% lower capital over-provisioning in pilot projects",
      "accuracy": "Forecasting accuracy improved by 20% vs baseline"
    },
    "business_outcome": "Enabled data-driven urban planning that reduced unnecessary infrastructure spend and improved cross-department alignment."
